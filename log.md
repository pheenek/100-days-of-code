# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 5, 2022 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Completed LeetCode problems 1 (Two Sum) and 2 (Add two numbers)

**Thoughts:** Ran into some weird issues with problem 1, turns out it was just an issue with the returnSize [in / out] variable.
Struggled a bit to formulate a solution to problem 2, trying to decide between a recursive and an iterative solution. Went with a recursive solution with good results. But, I'm still struggling slightly, taking longer than I anticipated formulating some of these solutions.
