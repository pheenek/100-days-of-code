# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed LeetCode problems 1 (Two Sum) and 2 (Add two numbers)

**Thoughts:** Ran into some weird issues with problem 1, turns out it was just an issue with the returnSize [in / out] variable.
Struggled a bit to formulate a solution to problem 2, trying to decide between a recursive and an iterative solution. Went with a recursive solution with good results. But, I'm still struggling slightly, taking longer than I anticipated formulating some of these solutions.

### Day 2: October 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tried out Leetcode 3, not very successful in getting a full proof solution. Almost always failed some test cases.

**Thoughts:** C definitely calls for more intelligent program design. There's so much freedom, but also a lot of batteries you have to construct yourself.
Finding the longest substring without repeating characters, including spaces, special symbols and digits, proved quite a challenge. I'll keep trying to solve it!

### Day 3: October 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tried out Leetcode 4, bugs, bugs, everywhere!

**Thoughts:** Futile attempt to implement array-merging. Perhaps a little more theory on array merging will do the trick? Still don't understand why it doesn't work, but I'm hardly surprised. The more complex the problem, the more that I realise that C is really not holding my hand, and I'm gonna have to figure out how to cope with the interesting but rather challenging problems on Leetcode. Perhaps implementing some data structures? We'll see

### Day 4: October 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finally got Leetcode 3 and 4 to pass all test cases.

**Thoughts:** Overlooking tiny details, and not accounting for edge cases, makes it hard to write code that handles all test cases in the first try. In addition to that, the algorithms I've been using haven't particularly been pretty. Primarily brute force, their runtimes can definitely be improved on. Marrying good algorithms with C is also a challenge. I'm hoping that I eventually get a technique that works, implementing some abstract data structures to achieve faster runtimes.
